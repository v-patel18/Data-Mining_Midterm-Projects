Price Predictor.ipynb is a python notebook that creates a model to predict house prices in Ames, Iowa. This project refers to the "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques" competition on Kaggle.com.

When run on Google Colab, the only action required is the uploading of the train.csv and test.csv files for the project at the beginning of the notebook. Other than that, running all the cells should generate the house price predictions for the test.csv files, along with the RMSE scoring for the models used.


Titanic Survivors.ipynb is a python notebook that executes classification modelling to predict which passengers in The Titanic would survive. This project refers to the "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster" competition on Kaggle.com

When run on Google Colab, the only action required is the uploading of the train.csv and test.csv files for the project at the beginning of the notebook. Other than that, running all the cells should generate the house price predictions for the test.csv files, along with the RMSE scoring for the models used.

The train and test files for each project have been provided in this repository.

Note: At the execution of the last block of code in each of the python notebooks, submission files for each of the projects will automatically be downloaded.
At the time of submission, the house price model ranked at position 876 (score: 0.1190), and the titanic model ranked at position 1534 (score: 0.7990)
